# The Complete Beginner's Guide to Becoming an Ethical Hacker in 2024

Ethical hacking involves using hacking skills and tools to identify weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications so organizations can fix them before they are maliciously exploited. If you want to become an ethical hacker, here is a deep dive into the skills you will need and how to start learning.

## Learn to Code Like a Hacker

Programming is the foundation for creating hacking tools and scripts as well as understanding vulnerabilities at a fundamental level.

- Python is a versatile, beginner-friendly language commonly used for hacking:
  - Learn core programming concepts like variables, data structures, functions
  - Work through Python tutorials and books focused on hacking
  - Build small projects that perform tasks like decrypting passwords
- Other useful languages include Java, C++, Ruby, and Bash scripting
- Use online IDEs and practice on virtual machines to code securely
- Learn to think like a hacker - spot flaws and loopholes when coding applications

## Dive Deep Into Computer Networks

Understanding how networks operate will empower you to manipulate and penetrate them.

- Master protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, SMTP, HTTP, wireless encryption
- Use network analysis tools like Wireshark and tcpdump to inspect traffic
- Set up a home lab network to experiment - configure routers, switches, firewalls
- Learn about vulnerabilities like DNS poisoning, SSL stripping, hijacking sessions
- Perform man-in-the-middle attacks by intercepting traffic between devices
- Do competitive challenges on sites like HackTheBox to practice hacking networks

## Become an Operating System Expert

Fluency in operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS is vital for testing and hardening them.

- Set up virtual machines to safely play with different OSs and distros
- Learn Windows internals - registry, file system, system calls, permissions
- Understand Linux under the hood - directory structure, shell scripting, processes
- Hack remote services by exploiting Windows RDP and Linux SSH
- Identify vulnerabilities like unpatched exploits, default accounts, weak passwords
- Practice hardening techniques like network segmentation, complex passwords, principle of least privilege

## Master the Art of Social Engineering

While controversial, social engineering can be an effective hacking technique when performed ethically.

- Only attempt with explicit permission - principles come first
- Common tactics include phishing, baiting, pretexting, and tailgating
- Build fake websites for phishing exercises to mimic trusted brands
- Learn psychological manipulation and how people divulge information
- Social engineering tests organizations' human vulnerabilities versus just technical
- Regularly educate staff on spotting fraudulent attempts to improve security

## Undertake Your Own Hacking Projects

Hands-on hacking experience is invaluable for honing your skills.

- Set up intentionally vulnerable web apps like WebGoat and deliberately hack them
- Compete in Capture the Flag competitions on platforms like HackTheBox
- Recreate real world scenarios like Wi-Fi password cracking with aircrack-ng
- Experiment with RADIUS and VLAN hopping attacks on practice networks
- Attempt privilege escalation, social engineering, and client-side attacks
- Build a report detailing vulnerabilities found and how organizations can fix them

## Leverage Online Training Resources

Take advantage of the wealth of affordable online learning available.

- Do beginner courses on Udemy, Cybrary, TryHackMe to build foundations
- Watch YouTube videos and presentations from conferences like DEF CON
- Join Discord groups and Reddit communities r/hacking to learn from others
- Read respected hacking blogs like Darknet Diaries for news and information
- Find a mentor in the industry who can provide guidance and support
- Work towards respected certifications like OSCP, CEH, Security+

## Maintain Your Skills with Ongoing Learning

Information security evolves extremely fast, demanding constant learning.

- Read books covering new attack techniques, tools, and vulnerabilities
- Regularly practice and refine your skills through CTFs and other challenges
- Listen to podcasts like Darknet Diaries and Hackable? during commutes
- Attend infosec conferences when possible - speak with other hackers
- Continuously update your knowledge as technology changes
- Strive to always act ethically as the industry continues to grow

The path to becoming an ethical hacker is challenging but rewarding. With patience and persistence, you can gain the expertise to succeed in 2024 and beyond. The most important first step is simply to start - begin coding, join an online community, watch some intro videos today. The hacking journey of a thousand miles begins with a single keystroke.
